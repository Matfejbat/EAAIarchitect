Traditional compliance management is broken. Manual audits, spreadsheets, and periodic reviews create gaps where violations can occur. **Compliance as Code** changes everything.

## What is Compliance as Code?

Compliance as Code embeds regulatory requirements directly into your architecture and infrastructure code. Instead of checking compliance quarterly, you validate it continuously with every change.

## Benefits

### Continuous Validation
Every architecture change is automatically validated against your compliance requirements in real-time.

### Reduced Risk
Catch compliance violations before they reach production, not during audits.

### Automated Documentation
Generate compliance reports automatically from your architecture code.

### Cost Savings
Reduce compliance overhead by up to 70% while improving coverage.

## How It Works

1. **Define Requirements**: Express compliance rules as executable policies
2. **Integrate**: Connect with your architecture and CI/CD systems
3. **Validate**: Automatic validation on every change
4. **Report**: Real-time dashboards and automated audit reports

## Example Use Cases

- **Financial Services**: Automate SOC 2, PCI-DSS validation
- **Healthcare**: Continuous HIPAA compliance monitoring
- **Global Enterprises**: Multi-framework compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
