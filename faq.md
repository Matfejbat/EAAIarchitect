# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is AI EA Architect?
AI EA Architect is an AI-powered platform that enables organizations to manage their Enterprise Architecture and Compliance as code. It combines Architecture as Code with Compliance as Code to create a unified, automated approach to EA management.

### How is this different from traditional EA tools?
Traditional EA tools rely on manual documentation and periodic reviews. AI EA Architect treats your architecture as executable code that can be versioned, validated, and automated. This means:
- Real-time validation instead of periodic reviews
- Version control for all architecture decisions
- Automated compliance checking
- AI-powered recommendations and optimizations

### What industries can benefit from AI EA Architect?
Any industry with complex architecture and compliance requirements can benefit, including:
- Financial Services (banking, insurance, fintech)
- Healthcare and life sciences
- Government and public sector
- Technology companies
- Retail and e-commerce
- Manufacturing
- Telecommunications

## Technical Questions

### What programming languages are supported?
AI EA Architect uses a declarative YAML/JSON-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) for defining architecture. You don't need to be a developer to use it. We also support:
- Python for custom scripts and integrations
- JavaScript/TypeScript for web integrations
- REST APIs for any language

### Can it integrate with my existing tools?
Yes! AI EA Architect integrates with:
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud
- **Architecture Tools**: ArchiMate, TOGAF, Sparx EA
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, New Relic, Splunk
- **Collaboration**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

### Is my data secure?
Absolutely. We take security seriously:
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- Data encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulation compliant
- Option for on-premise deployment (Enterprise plan)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Can I deploy this on-premise?
Yes, our Enterprise plan includes an on-premise deployment option. Contact our sales team to discuss your requirements.

### What compliance frameworks are supported?
We support all major compliance frameworks including:
- **Security**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST
- **Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA
- **Financial**: PCI-DSS, SOX, GLBA
- **Industry**: HITRUST, FedRAMP, StateRAMP
- **Custom**: Define your own compliance rules

## AI & Automation

### How does the AI work?
Our AI uses machine learning models trained on thousands of enterprise architectures and compliance frameworks. It:
- Analyzes your architecture for patterns and anti-patterns
- Suggests optimizations based on best practices
- Predicts potential issues before they occur
- Generates documentation automatically
- Validates compliance continuously

### Can I train the AI on my own data?
Yes! Enterprise customers can fine-tune the AI models with their own:
- Architecture patterns
- Compliance rules
- Industry-specific requirements
- Historical data

### Will the AI make changes automatically?
No. The AI provides recommendations and validations, but all changes require human approval. You maintain full control.

## Architecture as Code

### Do I need to learn a new language?
No. Our DSL (Domain Specific Language) is designed to be intuitive and human-readable. It uses familiar YAML/JSON syntax. Most users are productive within hours.

### Can I use my existing Git workflows?
Yes! Architecture as Code works with standard Git workflows:
- Branches for different architecture versions
- Pull requests for architecture reviews
- CI/CD for automated validation
- Tags for releases

### How do I version my architecture?
Your architecture is stored in Git, so you use standard Git versioning:
```bash
git commit -m "Add new microservice architecture"
git tag v1.0
git push
```

## Compliance as Code

### How accurate is the compliance validation?
Our compliance validation is rule-based and deterministic - it either passes or fails based on your defined rules. The AI helps:
- Suggest compliance rules based on frameworks
- Identify potential compliance gaps
- Recommend remediation steps

Accuracy depends on how well you've defined your compliance rules. We provide templates for common frameworks.

### Can I create custom compliance rules?
Yes! All plans support custom compliance rules. You define rules using our policy language, and they're validated automatically.

### How often is compliance checked?
Continuously. Every architecture change is validated against your compliance rules in real-time.
